# Python Sand Game

I created a program that simulates a falling sand world. The user can interact with the world by pressing the 'f' key to switch to floor mode, the 's' key to switch to sand mode, and the mouse to create and manipulate objects in the world.

In floor mode, the user can create floor regions by pressing, dragging, and releasing the mouse. When sand subsequently drops onto a region of floor, it will stay there rather than continue to fall.

I also implemented three additional behaviors:

    Sand flowing when it piles up
    Rain sprinkling down, then flowing sideways until it hits sand, floor, or the sides of the canvas. Press 'W' key.
    Marbles flowing down. Press 'M' key.
    

The program is written in Python and uses the dudraw library. Here are pictures of the project:
